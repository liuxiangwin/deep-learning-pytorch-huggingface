    "# RLHF in 2024 with DPO & Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post walks you through how to use DPO to improve open LLMs using Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) in 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research and experiments suggest that DPO should only be applied after SFT. This means we need an already fine-tuned LLM, which can be aligned with DPO. In this example we will use [cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b) a fine-tuned Mistral 7B with ChatML template. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup development environment\n",
    "2. Create and prepare the preference dataset\n",
    "3. Align LLM with TRL and the DPOTrainer\n",
    "4. Test LLM (vibe-check)\n",
    "5. Evaluate open LLMs on MT-Bench\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This example is designed to be an introduction to DPO and TRL. It is build for a single GPU environment to guide you through the process. For production use, you should consider using a distributed environment. It should be possible to run the example on a single GPU with at least 24GB of memory by reducing the training arguments, with batch size, max seq length and run evaluation after the training._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup development environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to install Hugging Face Libraries and Pytorch, including trl, transformers and datasets. If you haven't heard of trl yet, don't worry. It is a new library on top of transformers and datasets, which makes it easier to fine-tune, rlhf, align open LLMs."

Compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alignment methods require preference data. Preference data is crucial as it serves as a proxy against which the model's outputs are evaluated and aligned. A typical DPO dataset includes a triplet out of prompt, chosen, and rejected response. There are several ways to create such a dataset, including:\n",

    "- Using existing open-source datasets, e.g.,Â [SHP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/SHP)\n",

The best DPO dataset represents the real-world preferences of your users or customers. If you donât have collected preferences yet, start with your existing SFT data and use different sizes/quality LLMs to generate feedback.

The `DPOTrainer` is a subclass of the `Trainer` from the `transformers` library and supports all the same features, including logging, evaluation, and checkpointing. \n",
    "\n",
    "One big difference to SFT is that for DPO we need an additional Reference Model, which is used for KL-Divergence to help stabilize the training. The Reference Model is normally the same model as the one we are training, but frozen. This means for DPO you need additional memory and compute resources. To keep our example efficient we will use PEFT and adatpers. We load your fine-tuned and then add a new trainable adapters. This means that we will only tune adapters and not the whole model using DPO. The origian model will be then used as reference model itself. If you want to train all parameter with DPO you need to provide a `model` and `reference_model, but this requires more memory and compute resources.\n",

      "## How do you protect your yard from wild animals?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fencing â To protect your yard from wild animals, installing a fence is one of the most effective ways. A six-foot high fence made of chicken wire or welded wire can keep out raccoons and opossums, while a sturdy, eight-foot high fence can deter larger animals like deer.\n",

      "\n",
      "## What kind of food do llamas eat?\n",
      "\n",
      "Llamas are herbivores, which means they eat only plant-based foods. Their diet consists mainly of hay, grass, and small amounts of grain.

    "For our use case we will use [MT-Bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/llm_judge/README.md). MT-Bench is a Benchmark designed by LMSYS to test the conversation and instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It evaluates LLMs through multi-turn conversations, focusing on their ability to engage in coherent, informative, and engaging exchanges. Since human evaluation is very expensive and time consuming, LMSYS uses GPT-4-Turbo to grade the model responses. Their paper shows as 80% agreement between strong LLM and human preferences. The [LMSYS leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) is updated regularly (last updated February 2, 2024).
