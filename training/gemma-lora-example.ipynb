    "# How to Fine-Tune Gemma with ChatML and Hugging Face TRL\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, Google released [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma), a new family of state-of-the-art open LLMs. Gemma comes in two sizes: 7B parameters, for efficient deployment and development on consumer-size GPU and TPU and 2B versions for CPU and on-device applications. Both come in base and instruction-tuned variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first week it seemed that Gemma is not very friendly to fine-tune using the [ChatML format](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/ai-services/openai/includes/chat-markup-language.md#working-with-chat-markup-language-chatml), which is adapted and used by the open soruce community, e.g. OpenHermes or Dolphin. I created this blog post to show you how to fine-tune Gemma using ChatML and Hugging Face TRL. \n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post is derived from my [How to Fine-Tune LLMs in 2024 with Hugging Face](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-llms-in-2024-with-trl) blog tailored to fine-tune Gemma 7B. We will use Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup development environment\n",
    "2. Create and prepare the dataset\n",
    "3. Fine-tune LLM using `trl` and the `SFTTrainer` \n",
    "4. Test and evaluate the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This blog was created to run on consumer size GPUs (24GB), e.g. NVIDIA A10G or RTX 4090/3090, but can be easily adapted to run on bigger GPUs._"

The `SFTTrainer` makes it straightfoward to supervise fine-tune open LLMs. The `SFTTrainer` is a subclass of the `Trainer` from the `transformers` library and supports all the same features, including logging, evaluation, and checkpointing, but adds additiional quality of life features, including:\n",

    "_Note: Gemma comes with a big vocabulary of ~250,000 tokens. Normally if you want to fine-tune LLMs on the ChatML format you would need to add special tokens to the tokenizer and model and teach to understand the different roles in a conversation. But Google included ~100 placeholder tokens in the vocabulary, which we can replace with special tokens, like `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>`. I created a Tokenizer for the ChatML format [philschmid/gemma-tokenizer-chatml](https://huggingface.co/philschmid/gemma-tokenizer-chatml) which you can use to fine-tune Gemma with ChatML._\n",
