    "# How to Fine-Tune LLMs in 2024 with TRL\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models or LLMs have seen a lot of progress in the last year. We went from now ChatGPT competitor to a whole zoo of LLMs, including Meta AI's [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf), Mistrals [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) & [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) models, TII [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), and many more. \n",
    "Those LLMs can be used for a variety of tasks, including chatbots, question answering, summarization without any additional training. However, if you want to customize a model for your application. You may need to fine-tune the model on your data to achieve higher quality results than prompting or saving cost by training smaller models more efficient model.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "This blog post walks you thorugh how to fine-tune open LLMs using Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) in 2024. In the blog, we are going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define our use case \n",
    "2. Setup development environment\n",
    "3. Create and prepare the dataset\n",
    "4. Fine-tune LLM using `trl` and the `SFTTrainer` \n",
    "5. Test and evaluate the LLM\n",
    "6. Deploy the LLM for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This blog was created to run on consumer size GPUs (24GB), e.g. NVIDIA A10G or RTX 4090/3090, but can be easily adapted to run on bigger GPUs._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Define our use case \n",
    "\n",
    "When fine-tuning LLMs, it is important you know your use case and the task you want to solve. This will help you to choose the right model or help you to create a dataset to fine-tune your model. If you haven't defined your use case yet. You might want to go back to the drawing board. \n",
    "I want to mention that not all use cases require fine-tuning and it is always recommended to evaluate and try out already fine-tuned models or API-based models before fine-tuning your own model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we are going to use the following use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We want to fine-tune a model, which can generate SQL queries based on a natural language instruction, which can then be integrated into our BI tool. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to create a SQL query and make it easier for non-technical users to create SQL queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text to SQL can be a good use case for fine-tuning LLMs, as it is a complex task that requires a lot of (internal) knowledge about the data and the SQL language. \n"
